### Abstract

- Flashcards is a console based game that is played through the CLI (Command Line Interface).  The player is presented with a question, or 'flashcard', and can then answer the question before moving on the the next flashcard.  After all questions have been answered, the user receives feedback that includes their final score (percentage of questions correct).
